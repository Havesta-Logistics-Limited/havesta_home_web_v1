# Harvesta

Front-end web app for Havesta, built with React + Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Requirements

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start the dev server
- `npm run build` — build for production
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint (strict; warnings fail CI)

## Notes

- This project uses Vite, so environment variables are read from `import.meta.env` (e.g. `VITE_AUTH_ENDPOINT`).
